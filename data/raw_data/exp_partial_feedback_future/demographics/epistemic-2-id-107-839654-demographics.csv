If my chances of winning a dollar is already known to be higher, even just by five balls, then I would rather choose the known box. \nDuring the first experiment, the red side has a certain chance of gaining 48 to 51 points whereas blue side results in very high or very low points, maybe depending on the balls texture.""}","comments","survey-text","121","1336741","0.0-7.0","107","high","6.1"
