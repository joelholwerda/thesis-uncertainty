265407,"{""Q0"":""At first, I was a bit confused with what \""outcome\"" meant (outcome of what?) so didn't really understand the objective, but realised it was just the number of points from selecting it. In the first part I started off observing more than claiming but just then randomly claimed either one. Each time I observed the one on the left, it was more random than the right (around 50 points usually) but just clicked randomly. \n\nPart 2 - if it was close to 50/50, I chose the option on the right because (probably not mathematically accurate) but I felt like it would also be a 50/50 chance at getting a better chance of winning (50/50 that the higher proportion was the right coloured ball). I don't know if that makes sense!""}",comments,survey-text,111,1478325,0.0-109.0,21592,low,removed for privacy,4.5
