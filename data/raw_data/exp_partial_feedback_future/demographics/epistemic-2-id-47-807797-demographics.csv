"152978","{""Q0"":""I did the first exercise thinking it was probably a set of values for each, randomised, rather than in a set formation/pattern, but kept in mind it was possible there was a pattern/formation/determined set up of values for each in the quizzes about the values afterwards which is why I didnt answer completely 'not at all' to the questions about being able to determine the value in advance and what not. Naturally however I found that one ball produced a more stable outcome than the other in terms of the difference in value. Did not encounter any technical problems and instructions were clear!""}","comments","survey-text","121","875517","0.0-7.0","47","low","5.9"
