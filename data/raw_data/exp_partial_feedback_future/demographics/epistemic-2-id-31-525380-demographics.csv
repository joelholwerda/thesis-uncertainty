"161261","{""Q0"":""I tried to identify a number pattern in the planet-looking sphere exercise and found that the left red one went a few times on low numbers like 20's before spiking to 79 or 80, whereas most of the right blue sphere was around the 50 mark and every time it would repeat numbers on clicks i tried to swap over to red. \nFor a little while i also tested if the values obtained from clicking could be changed in time elapsed before making the decision but saw no results, similar to my curiosity if where on the sphere i clicked made a difference.
