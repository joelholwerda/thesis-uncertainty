216414,"{""Q0"":""The experiment was quite fun overall! \nThe choice between the red and blue was quite interesting as I found that for the blue one the points would always stay at an average of 50 regardless of the pattern but for the red it was seemingly random but did seem to be higher (80 points) for when the pattern was rough or brick-like. Hence, I mainly chose blue unless a clear brick pattern appeared for red. The second exercise was mainly just instinct. Instructions were clear and the entire experience was quite enjoyable.""}",comments,survey-text,111,1183351,0.0-109.0,20327,high,removed for privacy,4
