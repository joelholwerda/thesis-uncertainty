"159107","{""Q0"":""For the first game I realised that the red balls had very little variation, from around 48-52, so I chose blue when they were designs that I recognised as providing good outcomes in previous rounds and red when the blue ones were associated with numbers less than 48. I still am unsure as to whether this theory about the blue balls was successful but I would say it most probably was to some degree. Because I was focusing on the blue balls I have no idea whether the red designs were important in telling how much the red balls would be worth.""}","comments","survey-text","124","1479060","0.0-7.0","104","high","6.1"
