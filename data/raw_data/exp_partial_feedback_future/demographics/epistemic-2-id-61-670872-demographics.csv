"165283","{""Q0"":""1) Red ball was consistent amount (45-55) whereas blue ball will vary from 15-80. I found in general, the blue ball usually gave more low values than high values, hence I believe it was more optimal to pick the red ball. \n2) For 50/50 chance, I would take the risk because expected value is equal for both and I don't mind taking a risk. However, for the other ones, the expected value is higher for the known proportions (if we expected value the other ones are supposedly 50/50 as well). Hence, I picked the known value ones.
