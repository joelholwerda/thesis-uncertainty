Regarding the first section, it became clear that the left hand-side blue ball fluctuated in points just like the right hand-side orange ball did, but its range of fluctuation was not significant, and so was the safer ball to pick. The right hand-side ball fluctuated tremendously and was more of a riskier choice than was the blue ball. ""}","comments","survey-text","124","1067283","0.0-7.0","43","low","5.1"
