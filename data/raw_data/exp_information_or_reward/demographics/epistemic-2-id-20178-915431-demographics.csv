It seemed that the blue gave a random number of points either higher (above 75) or lower (below 40) while the red gave an even 45-55 points every time so I decided to select red instead of gambling on blue.\n\nFor the second game if that chance was over 60% I selected the higher probability, if it was 55% or lower I chose the unknown as I figured the chance of not getting an orange ball was high enough to take the risk anyway.""}",comments,survey-text,111,969997,0.0-109.0,20178,high,removed for privacy,5
