"240469","{""Q0"":""For the first experiment, I knew that the red ball had a consistent outcome and that the blue ball had random outcomes so with every 4 clicks, I would pick 3 reds and then 1 blue so that I was going to at least earn 150~ points. If I had clicked 3 blues and 1 red, I doubt I would earn 150 points since the points given ranged from 13-80. \n\nFor the second experiment, depending on the probability of winning, eg if there was 50%, I'd pick that one but if there was a difference in number of balls eg 30% orange, 70% purple, I may as well just pick randomly since there is a lower chance I'm going to win.
